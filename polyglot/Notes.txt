GraalVM 
	can write polyglot applications 
	seamlessly pass values from one language to another 
		Truffle language implementation framework.

Truffle 
	Java library 
	build programming languages implementations 
		as interpreters for self-modifying Abstract Syntax Trees. 
	When writing a language interpreter with Truffle
		automatically use the Graal compiler 
			as just-in-time compiler 
	
	so now e.g. 
	Ruby application
		can run on the same JVM as a Java application. 
	Host JVM-based language and a guest language 
		can directly interoperate 
		pass data back and forth 
			in the same memory space.
	
	Truffle introduces polyglot interoperability protocol 
	This interoperability protocol 
		consists of a set of standardized messages 
		that every language implements and 
		uses for foreign polyglot values. 
	The protocol allows GraalVM to support interoperability 
		between any combination of languages 
		without requiring them to know of each other. 
	For more details, proceed to the High-Performance Cross-Language Interoperability in a Multi-Language Runtime paper.



Running Polyglot Applications #
------------------------------
The below examples work:

on a JVM
	pass --polyglot --jvm.
on native launchers 
	--polyglot 
	(e.g., js --polyglot). 
	with native executables (e.g., native-image --language:js).


Lab: reference: polyglot folder in my repo.
	(a)	js --polyglot --jvm polyglot.js
	
	(b) node --polyglot --jvm polyglot.js
	
	(c) Rscript --polyglot --jvm polyglot.R
	
	(d) ruby --polyglot --jvm polyglot.rb
	
	(e) graalpython --polyglot --jvm polyglot.py
	
	(f) gu install llvm-toolchain
		export LLVM_TOOLCHAIN=$(lli --print-toolchain-path)
		$LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang polyglot.c -lgraalvm-llvm -o polyglot
		lli --polyglot polyglot


Note: 
	The polyglot launcher and the Polyglot Shell are experimental features in GraalVM.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	With polyglot applications 
		it is often impossible to decide what the primary language of an application is. 
	Therefore, an experimental new launcher, called polyglot, 
		has been added to GraalVM. 
	Currently launcher runs code for 
		JavaScript, 
		Ruby, and 
		R 
			without requiring the select primary language. 
	The polyglot launcher does not require the --polyglot option; 
		it is enabled by default.

	To execute polyglot launcher
		(a) polyglot --jvm polyglot.js polyglot.R polyglot.rb
		(b) polyglot --jvm polyglot.js
		(c) polyglot --jvm polyglot.R 
		(d) polyglot --jvm polyglot.rb

	basic experimental shell 
		for multiple languages called the Polyglot Shell. 
		why?
			Quickly test 
			
			polyglot --jvm --shell
		will provide a js shell for us to try



Polyglot Options 
----------------
Configure a language engine for better throughput or startup.

	--engine.Mode=default

	
		configures the execution mode of the engine. 
		execution mode 
			automatically tunes the polyglot engine for 
				latency or 
	--engine.Mode=throughput
		throughput.
					throughput: maximum amount of profiling information 
					compiles using the maximum number of optimizations. 
			Result: 
				slower application startup 
				but better throughput. 
				default uses a balanced engine configuration. 
	--engine.Mode=latency 
		latency 
			collects only minimal profiling information 
			compiles as fast as possible 
				less optimal-generated code. 
			result:
				faster application startup 
				but less optimal throughput. 
			This mode uses the compiler configuration economy if not specified otherwise.





Passing Options for Language Launchers 
----------------------------------------
language properties
-------------------
All language launchers 
	extended with a set of polyglot options. 
	Polyglot options 
		allow to access the options of other languages 
			supported by GraalVM 
			(implemented with the Truffle language implementation framework). 
	The format is: 
		--<languageID>.<property>=<value>. 
	For e.g., the 
		R launcher 
			supports the --js.atomics=true JavaScript option.

	Allowed values for the languageID are:
		js: options for JavaScript
		python: options for Python
		r: options for R
		ruby: options for Ruby
		llvm: options for LLVM

	Use --help:languages 
		which options are available.

tools properties
----------------
Options for polyglot tools work in the same way with the following format: 
	--<toolID>.<property>=<value>.

Allowed values for <toolID> are:
	inspect: allows debugging with Chrome DevTools
	cpusampler: collects data about CPU usage
	cputracer: captures trace information about CPU usage
	memtracer: captures trace information about memory usage

	Use --help:tools to find out which options are available.




Passing Options Programmatically
--------------------------------

Options can also be passed programmatically using the Java polyglot API.
	javac OptionsTest.java
	java OptionsTest

Note: Tools options can be passed in the same way. Options cannot be modified after the context was created.

Passing Options Using JVM Arguments
-----------------------------------
All polyglot option 
	can also be passed as a Java system property. 
Each available option 
	translates to a system property 
		with the polyglot. 
For e.g., 
	-Dpolyglot.js.strict=true 
		sets the default value 
			for a strict interpretation 
			for all JavaScript code that runs in the JVM. 
	Options that were set programmatically take precedence over Java system properties. 
	For languages the following format can be used: 
		-Dpolyglot.<languageID>.<property>=<value> 
	for tools : 
		-Dpolyglot.<toolID>.<property>=<value>.



https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Context.html

Context class (Refer Context class in polyglot example of graalvm getting started.
-------------
	public final class Context extends Object implements AutoCloseable
		A polyglot context 
			Graal guest languages 
			allows to evaluate code. 
	A polyglot context 
		represents the global runtime state 
			of all installed and permitted languages. 
	Permitted languages are initialized lazily (in Code)
		when used for the first time. 
	Most context operations
		needs to specify language identifier
		A language identifier is unique for each language.

	
Evaluation
	Context allows to evaluate (execute) a guest language 
		using Context.eval(Source). 
		Done by evaluating 
			Source objects: given language identifier and 
			code String. 
	The evaluation returns 
		either the result value or 
		throws a PolyglotException 
			
----------------------------
 Context context = Context.create();//create a new context with all permitted languages
 Value result = context.eval("js", "42");//evaluate the expression "42" with language "js"
 //"js": language identifier for javascript.
 //Since this is the first time we access JavaScript, it automatically gets initialized.
 assert result.asInt() == 42;//Convert result value as primitive int. assert the result value
 context.close();//context is no longer needed, close it to ensure that all resources are freed.
	//Contexts are also AutoCloseable for use with the Java try-with-resources statement.
----------------------------

	Java try-with-resources : New feature in java8
		https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html


Configuration
	Contexts can be created 
		1. default configuration 
			use create method 
	or 
		2. custom configuration 
			use builder. 
	In both methods 
		can specify a subset of the installed languages 
			as permitted languages. 
				Context.newBuilder("js", "R").out(myOut).option("js.Strict", "true").allowAllAccess(true).build();
				Context context = Context.newBuilder("js").allowHostAccess(true).build();
		If no language is specified 
			then all installed languages are permitted. 
		Using the builder method 
			input, 
			error and 
			output streams, 
			options, and 
			application arguments may be configured.

	Options may be specified for 
		languages, 
		instruments, the 
		engine and 
		the compiler. 
	For language options, 
		option key: 
			<language id>.<option> 
			(e.g. "js.Strict"). 
	For most languages
		option start: upper-case  

	Default: system properties are enabled
		specify all polyglot: prefix "polyglot." 
		(e.g. "-Dpolyglot.js.Strict=true"). 
	system properties 
		read only once 
			when context is created. 
	After that, 
		changes to the system properties have no affect.

	Each Graal language performs an initialization 
		before execute code
		then remains initialized for the lifetime of the context. 
	Initialization 
		default lazy and 
		automatic, 
		can be forced manually if needed.
  

------------------------------------------------------------------
 OutputStream myOut = new BufferedOutputStream()
 Context context = Context.newBuilder("js", "R")//we create a new context.
                          .out(myOut)// set the standard output stream
                          .option("js.Strict", "true")//option for JavaScript language only
                          .allowAllAccess(true)// grant a new context instance with the same access privileges as the host virtual machine
                          .build();
 context.eval("js", "42");//js gets initialized
 context.eval("R", "42");// R language expression gets evaluated.
 context.close();//close the context -free all allocated resources. 
				//Contexts are also AutoCloseable for use with the Java try-with-resources statement.

Bindings
--------
	The symbols of the top-most scope 
		can be accessed using the language bindings. 
	Each language provides its own bindings object for a context. 
	The bindings object may be used to 
		read, 
		modify, 
		insert and 
		delete 
			members in the top-most scope of the language. 
	Certain languages may not allow write access to the bindings object. 
	A context instance also provides access to the polyglot bindings. 
	The polyglot bindings are shared between languages and may be used to exchange values. 
	See Context.getPolyglotBindings() for details.

	Examples using language bindings from JavaScript:

	 Context context = Context.create("js");
	 Value jsBindings = context.getBindings("js")

	 jsBindings.putMember("foo", 42);
	 assert context.eval("js", "foo").asInt() == 42;

	 context.eval("js", "var bar = 42");
	 assert jsBindings.getMember("bar").asInt() == 42;

	 assert jsBindings.getMember("Math")
					  .getMember("abs")
					  .execute(-42)
					  .asInt() == 42;
	 context.close();
	 
	In this example:
	We create a new context with JavaScript as the only permitted language.
	Next, we load the JavaScript bindings object and assign it to a local variable jsBindings.
	Then, we insert a new member foo into to the bindings object and verify that the object is accessible within the language by reading from a global symbol with the same name.
	After that, we declare a new global variable in JavaScript and verify that it is accessible as member of the language bindings object.
	Next, we access we access a JavaScript builtin named Math.abs symbol and execute it with -42. This result is asserted to be 42.
	Finally, we close the context to free all allocated resources.
 
Host Interoperability
It is often necessary to interact with values of the host runtime and Graal guest languages. Such objects are referred to as host objects. Every Java value that is passed to a Graal language is interpreted according to the specification described in Context.asValue(Object). Also see Value.as(Class) for further details.
By default only public classes, methods, and fields that are annotated with @HostAccess.Export are accessible to the guest language. This policy can be customized using Context.Builder.allowHostAccess(HostAccess) when constructing the context.

Example using a Java object from JavaScript:

 public class JavaRecord {
     @HostAccess.Export public int x;

     @HostAccess.Export
     public String name() {
         return "foo";
     }
 }
 Context context = Context.create();

 JavaRecord record = new JavaRecord();
 context.getBindings("js").putMember("javaRecord", record);

 context.eval("js", "javaRecord.x = 42");
 assert record.x == 42;

 context.eval("js", "javaRecord.name()").asString().equals("foo");
 
Error Handling
Program execution may fail when executing a guest language code or when accessing guest language object. Almost all methods in the Context and Value API throw a PolyglotException in case an error occurs. See PolyglotException for further details on error handling.
Isolation
Each context is by default isolated from all other instances with respect to both language evaluation semantics and resource consumption. By default, a new context instance has no access to host resources, like threads, files or loading new host classes. To allow access to such resources either the individual access right must be granted or all access must be set to true.
Contexts can be configured to share certain system resources like ASTs or optimized code by specifying a single underlying engine. See Engine for more details about code sharing.

Context can be configured to allow value sharing between multiple contexts (allowed by default). See Context.Builder.allowValueSharing(boolean) for details.

Proxies
The proxy interfaces allow to mimic guest language objects, arrays, executables, primitives and native objects in Graal languages. Every Graal language will treat proxy instances like objects of that particular language. Multiple proxy interfaces can be implemented at the same time. For example, it is useful to provide proxy values that are objects with members and arrays at the same time.
Thread-Safety
It is safe to use a context instance from a single thread. It is also safe to use it with multiple threads if they do not access the context at the same time. Whether a single context instance may be used from multiple threads at the same time depends on if all initialized languages support it. If initialized languages support multi-threading, then the context instance may be used from multiple threads at the same time. If a context is used from multiple threads and the language does not fit, then an IllegalStateException is thrown by the accessing method.
Meta-data from the context's underlying engine can be retrieved safely by any thread at any time.

A context may be closed from any thread, but only if the context is not currently executing code. If the context is currently executing some code, a different thread may kill the running execution and close the context using Context.close(boolean).

Context Exit
A context is exited naturally by calling the Context.close(boolean) method. A context may also be exited at the guest application request. There are two ways a guest language may exit.
Soft exit. A guest language throws a special exception that causes the embedder thread to eventually throw a PolyglotException with PolyglotException.isExit() returning true and PolyglotException.getExitStatus() returning the exit status code specified by the guest application. The special exception does not influence other threads and does not trigger context close on its own. Closing the context is up to the embedder.
Hard exit. A guest language uses a builtin command that unwinds all context threads and closes the context by force. Embedder threads also throw a PolyglotException with PolyglotException.isExit() returning true and PolyglotException.getExitStatus() returning the exit status code specified by the guest application. However, the context is closed automatically. The hard exit can be customized using Context.Builder.useSystemExit(boolean). If true, the context threads are unwound by calling System.exit(int) with the exit status parameter specified by the guest application. This operation terminates the whole host application.
Pre-Initialization
The context pre-initialization can be used to perform expensive builtin creation in the time of native compilation.
The context pre-initialization is enabled by setting the system property polyglot.image-build-time.PreinitializeContexts to a comma separated list of language ids which should be pre-initialized, for example: -Dpolyglot.image-build-time.PreinitializeContexts=js,python

See com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage.patchContext(java.lang.Object, com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage.Env) for details about pre-initialization for language implementers.
